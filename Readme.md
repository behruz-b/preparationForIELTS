#PreparationForIELTS#
This is website as name for preparing for IELTS online. Yeah,it can be similar websites which exist, but my website will
help to teachers who prepare make-up class on English, especially IELTS. Here main attention will be checking the compositions(essays),
it is a difference among other sites.Incidentally essays will check by hand in the beginning then it also will check automatically.
In addition the website will has 4 types, there are: Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking.

  So following we will consider the structure of site:
  **
  The site includes timer that the reader must be in time to read and understand the meaning of text, and answer the questions
   after every part of text. Questions will be different, they can be "short answer", "choosing a right answer among 3 or 5 variants",
   or write oneself, of course they are in reading part of site.

  **
  Listening is also can be similar as reading  
  **

    But in the writing and speaking it has some differences. In writing part includes area where --student-- have to write
    not less than require, it depends of step of study. And if the essay will less than require the answer won't accept.And 
    the last speaking will connected with program that voice recognition and give the permission continue if the voice sounds
    correctly.
