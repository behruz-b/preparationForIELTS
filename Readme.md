This is website as name for preparing for IELTS online. Yeah,it can be similar websites which exist, but my website will
help to teachers who prepare make-up class on English, especially IELTS. Here main attention will be checking the compositions(essays),
it is a difference among other sites.Incidentally essays will check in the beginning then it also will check automatically.
In addition the website will has 4 types, there are: Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking.

  So following we will consider the structure of site:
  The site includes timer that the reader must be in time to read and understand the meaning of text, and answer the questions
   after every part of text. Questions will be different, they can be "short answer", "choosing a right answer among 3 or 5 variants",
   or write oneself, of course they are in reading part of site.
